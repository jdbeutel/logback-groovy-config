Groovy Config Writer
-------------------------------
This Library brings back the Groovy DSL for configuring Logback. There was some concern about security of the DSL so this library adds
security via the SecureASTCustomizer.

Note while this is meant to be more secure than the initial implementation, and while I will give some opinions on how you might be use this
library is a more secure manner, your application security is up to you. You use this library at your own risk. If you find any flaws/security
risks you can log them on the GitHub Issues Page:
