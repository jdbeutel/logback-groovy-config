== Getting Started

1. Add the following dependency to .build.gradle:

```groovy
compile 'io.github.virtualdogbert:logback-groovy-config:1.0-RC1'
```

Eventually the parent Logback Library should add hooks allowing to you specify the `logback.groovy` file just as you have before. Prior to
that you can use the following to run the DSL on a logback groovy config file:

```groovy
import ch.qos.logback.classic.LogbackDSLInitializer
LogbackDSLInitializer.init((LoggerContext) LoggerFactory.getILoggerFactory(),  getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("logback-config.groovy"))
```

Note the file can be called anything but `logback.groovy` and in this case `logback-config.groovy` was chosen. This file needs to be in a
resource directory to be picked up.
