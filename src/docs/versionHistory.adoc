== Version History
* 1.14.1, 1.13.1, 1.12.1
** Found an issue in #4 where the ScriptExpressionChecker was being overzealous on method calls from objects that has sub objectExpressions
that had types. So I loosened that up, and check for System and String types under the object type, and those have  a restricted set of methods
that they can call.
** Upgraded to versions 1.4.6, 1.3.6, and 1.2.12 for logback versions
** 1.2.12 is being release because there are still a lot of popular projects still using the old version(updated recently).
With this version the config file will be name logback-config.groovy,
because at this point logback will error if you have a logback.groovy.
* 1.14.0
** Upgrading to Logback 1.4.5
* 1.13.0
** Upgrading to Logback 1.3.5
** Changing default filename back to `logback.groovy`
** removing JMX config because it was removed from 1.3.5 because of potential vulnerability
* 1.0
** Initial Release
